# Collaborative Tennis

## Introduction

In this project, I trained a deep reinforcement learning agent using [MADDPG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf) (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm to play collaborative tennis on Unity ML-agent. Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. This particular setting is known as the [tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment. For this particular project, the problem setup is modified by Udacity and the objective is for the two agents is to keep the ball in play by controlling rackets to bounce a ball over a net.

Here is how the trained agent behave:
